The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},

While national approaches of implementing integrated ePHR vary, the middle out method has been recognised as the ideal approach. It is worth considering the adoption of ePHRs has been slow due to several factors, including technical, individual, environmental, social, and legal factors.

For example, themonitoring of employee e-mails by employers to prevent them fromwasting organisation's resources on non-business activities. Thisarticle seeks to investigate security, privacy and ethical dilemmas inthe electronic records management environment in the South Africanpublic sector. In order to draw inferences and recommendations, asurvey was conducted on existing national government departmentsin South Africa. Firstly, findings of the literature review (contentanalysis) are discussed. Secondly, the results from the survey areanalysed and interpreted. The article concludes by arguing that withouta proper information security framework and professional code ofethics that embrace electronic records management, governmentdepartments could expose themselves to unnecessary financiallosses due to litigations resulting from invasion of privacy and unethical behaviour, and urges government departments in South Africa to implement Electronic Document and Records Management Systems that are able to capture records in read-only format and generate a non-editable audit trail of all actions to address security dilemmas of electronic records.}

  abstract = {During the past decade, there have been many regional, national and European projects focused on the development of platforms for secure access and sharing of distributed patient information. A platform is needed because present local or enterprise-wide information systems are typically not intended for cross-organisational secure access of patient data. Most of the present secure platforms are local or regional. Commonly used platform types in the health care environment vary from secure point-to-point communication systems to internet-based portals. This paper defines an enhanced cross-security platform which makes it possible for different kinds of local, regional, and national health information systems to communicate in a secure way. The proposed evolutionary way interconnects regional or national security domains with the help of a cross-platform zone. A more revolutionary model based on peer-to-peer Grid like networks and dynamic security credentials is also discussed. The proposed evolutionary model uses cross-domain security and interoperability services to ensure secure communication and interoperability between different security domains. The platform supports both communication defined beforehand and adhoc dynamic access to distributed electronic health records (EHRs). The internet is proposed as the "glue" between different regional or national security domains.}

Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modelling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.Data integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.},

  abstract = {Data warehousing is becoming an indispensable component in data mining process and business intelligence. Data warehouses often act as a data collector, data integrator and data provider in the data mining process. This paper reviews the development and use of a clinical data warehouse specific to the Lymphoma or Lymph Node cancer, which could be used by doctors, physicians and other health professionals, in conjunction with a Clinical Decision Support System (DSS), to support the clinical process as well as to formulate the appropriate model to improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment recommendation decision making. This paper proposes a 5-stage sequential methodology for the clinical data warehouse development. Research on the evaluation of the developed data warehouse and how it would support the data mining process will be discussed in a separate paper.},

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.},
